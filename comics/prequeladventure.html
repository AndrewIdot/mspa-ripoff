							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/shipleave.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>One month ago you made yourself a promise: you were going to turn your life around. You were going to get a real job, stay out of jail, and not get into any more trouble with cults. Nobody thought you could do it; they said your questionable reputation, lack of any useful skills, and flagrant alcoholism would always hold you down. </p>
							<p>But you had a plan. </p>
							<p>You were going to start over, far from home. You pawned off your belongings, withdrew the rest of your inheritance, and narrowly managed to buy your way onto a merchant ship bound for Cyrodiil.</p>
							<p>And now you have arrived, alone and penniless in a foreign country. Rounding up to the nearest week, you’ve been sober for an entire seven days. This is your chance to be whatever you want to be. <em>Whoever</em> you want to be. </p>
							<p>You think you’ll start with a new name. Something less ethnic, maybe suitably <em>Imperial</em>, to fit in in your new home. </p>

							<p>N.. no… NO!</p>
							<p>There is something far too… <em>royal</em> about that name. Something that strikes fear in your soul.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/thekings.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You’ve never understood why kings scare you. Maybe it’s those crowns – jagged rims glistening like a dozen metal teeth burst forth from their skull, a vestigial maw seeking to devour any so unfortunate to find themselves upon it. Maybe it’s their clothes – an ocean of sparkling purple silk dragged behind them like the vicious tendrils of an unholy carnivorous plant. Maybe it’s their very expression – the way it oozes that solemn, dutiful dedication to their country. </p>
							<p>“Scare” might even be too weak a word. <em>Dukes</em> terrify you, as do Princes, Counts, and Barons. But Kings, Queens, Emperors… you don’t know what you’d do if you ever found yourself face-to-face with one. Probably curl up and cry. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/theking.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You used to have a recurring nightmare where you were trapped in a small, dark room with a King. There’s no way out. No one to help you. And he just stands there, <em>being a king</em>. Luckily, you’ve mostly taken care of your nightmare problem through heavy self-medication. Though you guess the self-medication became the bigger problem.</p>

							<p>This name sounds pretty cool though. You like the way it rolls off your sandpapery tongue. You jot it down and hand the immigration form to the guard. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/immigration2.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>The guard says you can keep it if you want. They don’t actually keep track of immigration, and he only brought the form because you asked. He’s just going to throw it out. </p>
							<p>You tell him you don’t care. This has symbolic value to you. It makes your new life feel <em>official</em>. He obliges and accepts the document. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/immigration3.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Not many people out here; everyone must be inside. Looks like there’s some shops near the dock. One appears to be a general store, the other some kind of restaurant. </p>

							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story0.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Suffice to say, your childhood was not full of encouragement, your adolescence was not full of employment, and your adulthood has not been full of success. Each one sort of led into the next, which is to say “nowhere”. It’s one of the things you’re hoping to fix in your new life. Someday, you’ll be <em>good</em> at something. Or even just adequate at it. It would make you so happy.  </p>
							<p>But for the time being you’re pretty much worthless. I mean, you know a pretty interesting party trick involving a yoyo and a pineapple, but… it’s not appropriate for most parties.</p>

							<p>Right now, however, your best bet for steady employment seems to be the restaurant. And hey, you’re Cyrodiillian now, may as well get to know the locals. </p>

							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story3.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>The proprietor is some kind of elf. There’s like a billion kinds of elves, you can never keep them straight. He welcomes you to The Flowing Bowl and asks if you would like to see a menu. </p>

							<p>This is definitely a menu meant for sailors. You guess that’s what you have to expect at a port town. It’s all out of your price range, too – that is to say, nothing is free.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story5.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>But you’re not going to let that bring your spirits down. You compliment the elf on his fine seaside establishment and alluring menu, then clumsily segue into how you are broke and looking for a job. Maybe he needs a maid to clean up at the end of the day, or a waitress to service tables? Or someone to do both for the wage of one?</p>
							<p>Him and his brother manage to handle all the chores around here, he explains. There’s not really any need for a third employee, no matter how many jobs she was willing to take up and how little wage she was willing to accept. Between the two of them, there is more than enough manpower to keep the food cooked, sailors fed, the tables spotless.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story6.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You have a sneaking suspicion they aren’t actually brothers. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story7.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You’ve been in Cyrodiil for all of fifteen minutes and your ambitious dreams of starting anew are already feeling a bit shakier. You confess that you didn’t plan ahead very well and are in dire need of employment. Is there anyone in town who might need some menial labor? You’re willing to learn new skills. You’re scared and alone and just need a place to sleep and a way to put food on the table. </p>
							<p>The gay elves explain that many trading ships come through this port. If you have any valuable possessions, you may be able to sell them for a good price. If you don’t have any valuable possessions… well, maybe someone else will need a maid or something. You could ask around.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story8.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Your only possessions in the world right now are the clothes on your back and this lockpick you found on the floor of the ship. You have no idea how to use a lockpick.</p>

							<p>These gay elves are racist fucks and you don’t want to talk to them anymore. Maybe you’ll go check around for a bulletin board offering jobs, or ask that store owner if you can redesign his sign. You could try to sell your clothes, but that would just leave you with no pockets to hold your money and lockpick, and you’d probably get arrested for public indecency anyway. Or maybe you can forget about the whole “keep a good reputation” thing and go find a party where you can do your pineapple tri- oh hey that lady with the bottle is yelling something incoherent at you. Maybe you should reply, or just walk away very quickly.</p>
