							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/shipleave.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>One month ago you made yourself a promise: you were going to turn your life around. You were going to get a real job, stay out of jail, and not get into any more trouble with cults. Nobody thought you could do it; they said your questionable reputation, lack of any useful skills, and flagrant alcoholism would always hold you down. </p>
							<p>But you had a plan. </p>
							<p>You were going to start over, far from home. You pawned off your belongings, withdrew the rest of your inheritance, and narrowly managed to buy your way onto a merchant ship bound for Cyrodiil.</p>
							<p>And now you have arrived, alone and penniless in a foreign country. Rounding up to the nearest week, you’ve been sober for an entire seven days. This is your chance to be whatever you want to be. <em>Whoever</em> you want to be. </p>
							<p>You think you’ll start with a new name. Something less ethnic, maybe suitably <em>Imperial</em>, to fit in in your new home. </p>

							<p>N.. no… NO!</p>
							<p>There is something far too… <em>royal</em> about that name. Something that strikes fear in your soul.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/thekings.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You’ve never understood why kings scare you. Maybe it’s those crowns – jagged rims glistening like a dozen metal teeth burst forth from their skull, a vestigial maw seeking to devour any so unfortunate to find themselves upon it. Maybe it’s their clothes – an ocean of sparkling purple silk dragged behind them like the vicious tendrils of an unholy carnivorous plant. Maybe it’s their very expression – the way it oozes that solemn, dutiful dedication to their country. </p>
							<p>“Scare” might even be too weak a word. <em>Dukes</em> terrify you, as do Princes, Counts, and Barons. But Kings, Queens, Emperors… you don’t know what you’d do if you ever found yourself face-to-face with one. Probably curl up and cry. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/theking.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You used to have a recurring nightmare where you were trapped in a small, dark room with a King. There’s no way out. No one to help you. And he just stands there, <em>being a king</em>. Luckily, you’ve mostly taken care of your nightmare problem through heavy self-medication. Though you guess the self-medication became the bigger problem.</p>

							<p>This name sounds pretty cool though. You like the way it rolls off your sandpapery tongue. You jot it down and hand the immigration form to the guard. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/immigration2.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>The guard says you can keep it if you want. They don’t actually keep track of immigration, and he only brought the form because you asked. He’s just going to throw it out. </p>
							<p>You tell him you don’t care. This has symbolic value to you. It makes your new life feel <em>official</em>. He obliges and accepts the document. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/immigration3.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Not many people out here; everyone must be inside. Looks like there’s some shops near the dock. One appears to be a general store, the other some kind of restaurant. </p>

							<p>Your… trade skills? You always get a little uncomfortable when the T-word pops into your head. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story0.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Suffice to say, your childhood was not full of encouragement, your adolescence was not full of employment, and your adulthood has not been full of success. Each one sort of led into the next, which is to say “nowhere”. It’s one of the things you’re hoping to fix in your new life. Someday, you’ll be <em>good</em> at something. Or even just adequate at it. It would make you so happy.  </p>
							<p>But for the time being you’re pretty much worthless. I mean, you know a pretty interesting party trick involving a yoyo and a pineapple, but… it’s not appropriate for most parties.</p>

							<p>Right now, however, your best bet for steady employment seems to be the restaurant. And hey, you’re Cyrodiillian now, may as well get to know the locals. </p>

							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story3.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>The proprietor is some kind of elf. There’s like a billion kinds of elves, you can never keep them straight. He welcomes you to The Flowing Bowl and asks if you would like to see a menu. </p>

							<p>This is definitely a menu meant for sailors. You guess that’s what you have to expect at a port town. It’s all out of your price range, too – that is to say, nothing is free.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story5.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>But you’re not going to let that bring your spirits down. You compliment the elf on his fine seaside establishment and alluring menu, then clumsily segue into how you are broke and looking for a job. Maybe he needs a maid to clean up at the end of the day, or a waitress to service tables? Or someone to do both for the wage of one?</p>
							<p>Him and his brother manage to handle all the chores around here, he explains. There’s not really any need for a third employee, no matter how many jobs she was willing to take up and how little wage she was willing to accept. Between the two of them, there is more than enough manpower to keep the food cooked, sailors fed, the tables spotless.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story6.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You have a sneaking suspicion they aren’t actually brothers. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story7.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You’ve been in Cyrodiil for all of fifteen minutes and your ambitious dreams of starting anew are already feeling a bit shakier. You confess that you didn’t plan ahead very well and are in dire need of employment. Is there anyone in town who might need some menial labor? You’re willing to learn new skills. You’re scared and alone and just need a place to sleep and a way to put food on the table. </p>
							<p>The gay elves explain that many trading ships come through this port. If you have any valuable possessions, you may be able to sell them for a good price. If you don’t have any valuable possessions… well, maybe someone else will need a maid or something. You could ask around.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story8.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Your only possessions in the world right now are the clothes on your back and this lockpick you found on the floor of the ship. You have no idea how to use a lockpick.</p>

							<p>In retrospect your tone was probably a little too aggressive. </p>
							<p>They retort that there’s a sale on Fancy Feast at the Imperial City. Shouldn’t you be headed off that way? </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story12.gif" alt=""></center>

							<p>These gay elves are racist fucks and you don’t want to talk to them anymore. Maybe you’ll go check around for a bulletin board offering jobs, or ask that store owner if you can redesign his sign. You could try to sell your clothes, but that would just leave you with no pockets to hold your money and lockpick, and you’d probably get arrested for public indecency anyway. Or maybe you can forget about the whole “keep a good reputation” thing and go find a party where you can do your pineapple tri- oh hey that lady with the bottle is yelling something incoherent at you. Maybe you should reply, or just walk away very quickly.</p>

							<p>She heard you were new in town. Yes, you reply. That’s cool, she says. She was new once too. She didn’t really know what to do with her life. Then she met some nice people in robes who gave her food and a place to stay and something to believe in but she’s not supposed to tell you about them. That’s okay, you say, you don’t want to know. She appreciates your non-prying-ness and declares you to be her best friend. </p>
							<p>She takes another swig and goes off on a tangent about how she left the peas on her plate because peas are the worst fruit. She’s not even entirely sure they are a fruit. She says you can have them if you want, but you say you’re not hungry. You also point out she is still waving a knife at you. She apologizes, sometimes she just <em>knifes</em> people.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story17.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You look thirsty, she says. You should have some of this awesome wine. In fact, you have to have some, it’s just that good. You nervously try to explain that you are a recovering alcoholic and have the booze tolerance of an anorexic six-year-old, but your new friend insists you are just pussying out. Pussy pussy pussy. She asks again if you would like a drink. </p>
							<p>Frankly, you would <em>love</em> a drink right now. Also she has a knife.</p>

							<p>After spending the last several hours cowering behind the guard, you decide that this is an opportune moment to inquire as to whether you can join the city watch. You explain that you don’t have any experience and have never held a weapon in your life but you have a willingness to learn new things and will work very hard. One day, you say, you will be the best guard. What do you think?</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story23b.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>The guard looks at you with a troubled, uncomfortable glare, like that of a man who must explain to his paraplegic daughter that her dreams of becoming a ballerina will never come true. He struggles to find the softest words, some gentle way to let you know that you’re not exactly what they want in a guard. You’re scrawny and unintimidating; nobody would ever say “hey, you should consider joining the guard”. They just don’t need you. </p>
							<p>Your astute senses pick up on his internal struggle. It is time to up the ante.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story23c.gif" alt=""></center>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story24.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Maybe you could be a guard, he says. Usually guards are tough and brave but sometimes there are exceptions, perhaps? If you work hard enough you can accomplish your dreams, whatever they are. </p>
							<p>He doesn’t have the authority to accept you into the guard, though. You’ll have to go to the castle and speak to the Countess.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/thekings.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>Suddenly becoming a guard doesn’t sound like such a great idea.  </p>

							<p>You excitedly say hello to the nice man and explain that you have no money. But you wish you did, because his store is very nice and appears well-stocked! It is probably a lot of work running this store all by himself and you would be happy to help if he needed it. Did you mention you are broke? Sorry if you already mentioned that. </p>
							<p>Also it is a shame his wonderful store lacks an adequate sign to match.</p>

							<p>He knows his sign is not very good, he tells you. He’s been planning to replace it, and even bought a new blank sign. However, he doesn’t want to ruin this expensive new sign with his abysmal handwriting. He’s been hoping to run into someone who was willing to help out. </p>
							<p>This is exciting! You should be excited. But your eyes are stuck on that damn bottle he left out in the open. </p>

							<p>Lelles admires the legibility of your handwriting, though he actually needs the sign engraved and he thinks the flowers and smiling heart might not be reaching the store’s target audience. Maybe you could just carve “Lelles’ Quality Merchandise” in fancy letters? He’ll give you maybe ten Septims if you do a good job. That should be enough to get you a good meal and a night at an inn. </p>
							<p>You accept. </p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story33.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You spend the following hours toiling away on the wooden sign using Lelles’ tools. You know this has to be your best work. This little sign will be the first thing you are <em>known</em> for. This is your first step in the right direction. You put your heart into every letter, polishing every curve and serif to perfection. Once your engraving reaches the pinnacle of artistic quality, you carefully dab a fine coat of white paint onto every character. It is beautiful. </p>
							<p>By the end, your arm is cramped and your eyes are strained. But you don’t care, you’ve made something good and are going to reap the benefits. Time to show Lelles.</p>

							<p>Wait, you say, maybe you can fix it. It’s still much better than the original sign so maybe people won’t care about this one little mistake that you shouldn’t have made and oh gods it looks so stupid why did you do this you’re just making it worse. Now even people who don’t know how to spell will know you made a mistake. </p>

							<p>It’s okay, Lelles tells you. You tried your best. Your “best” just happened to be slightly worse than everyone else’s “average”. He figures he can still use the sign, though people might think he’s kind of dumb because of it. You say you’re sorry, sorry sorry sorry, and ask if there is anything else you can do at all to make it up to him. He says no, he thinks you’ve done enough. You should go now. But you do deserve some compensation for your hard work.</p>
							<p>You’ll happily accept less than ten, you say. Maybe eight Septims?</p>
							<p>Oh shit no, lady. Lelles got a business to run here, and Lelles all about quality. He’ll give you one. </p>
							<p>Whatever.</p>
							<center><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/story38.gif" alt=""></center>
							<p>You take your payment and leave. It’s cold and dark outside.</p>
							<p>Maybe one Septim is all you are worth. Maybe everyone was right after all. You thought maybe if you went far away, you could leave it all behind and make something of yourself. You tried as hard as you could, and have a single coin to show for it. Lelles was right; your best just isn’t good enough.</p>
							<p>You feel terrible. All you can think about is how wrong you were. How you ruined everything. </p>

							<p class="first-para">By clicking the link on the sidebar nobody looks at, you have found the secret “Side Stories” page! To reward your adventuresome spirit, here are some extra little updates that have been created over the years. They are mostly about argonians. </p>
							<p>It is recommended that you <a href="?p=1">read the comic</a> before reading these. Without that context, they might be really weird! Actually, that might make them more fun. Go for it.</p>

							<p>A brief exchange in the old commands thread about whether or not Asotil had unknowingly <a href="//www.prequeladventure.com/2011/07/550/">taken a bite of the poisoned apple</a> inspired me to illustrate a little (non-canon) update demonstrating the speed at which poisoned apples work.

							<p>I decided I was going to win a T-shirt design contest. For some people this would involve making a really good design. For me, it involved asking thousands of readers to vote. Whoops! This update was created as a reward for anyone who signed in to rate the designs, and occurs concurrently with <a href="//www.prequeladventure.com/2013/05/katia-follow-captain/">this update</a>, except from Quill-Weave’s point of view.</p>

							<p>For round two of the T-shirt contest, I created an update that gradually revealed itself as more people voted for my design. This update occurs concurrently with <a href="//www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/164/">this one</a>, but from Quill-Weave’s point of view.</p>

							<p>Working on merchandise caused some delays in the comic, so to make up for it I decided to make a small sidestory showcasing Katia’s trip to Cyrodiil. I messed up hard, though, and the “small sidestory” became the comic’s single largest and most complicated page to date.</p>

							<p>To promote the first merchandise crowdfunding campaign, I posted a sidestory that would gradually appear as people contributed. It takes place 28 years before the beginning of Prequel.</p>
							<p><a href="?p=-7"></a></p><center><a href="?p=-7"><img style="margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px" src="images/prequel/iconreceipt.gif" alt=""></a></center><center><strong>10/31/2016</strong> <a href="?p=-7"><em>Crowdfunding Receipt comic</em></a></center><p></p>
							<p>When the T-shirts and other physical goods from the first crowdfunding campaign were sent out, every package contained a short black-and-white “receipt comic” with slightly different scenes depending <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/katia-managan-merchandise-fantasy-videogames#/">what items the person received</a>. The version depicted here was the one included with the “Everything” pack. As for how it fits into the overall story, let’s call this it “non-canon, but feasible”. </p>

							<p>Getting over-ambitious with <i>Katia: Infiltrate</i> led to a long hiatus. Whoops! Toward the end of that hiatus, I posted this riveting look at the ancestral guardian’s life (in the figurative sense) before meeting Katia. </p>

							<p>Embrace nostalgia with a <a href="prequel/rise.html"><b>NEW SIDESTORY</b></a> that is actually just a full-length text-based adventure game following up on <a href="?p=-6">Dodger: Break the Law</a>! Most of you won’t have nostalgia for this frustrating genre that died for a reason, but you <i>will</i> have nostalgia for Homestar Runner’s <a href="http://homestarrunner.com/dungeonman" target="_blank">2004 parody</a> of it, and have probably wondered what Prequel would be like if Katia was dumb enough to unquestioningly follow every command she was given (hint: short).</p>
